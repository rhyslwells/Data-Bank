# Description

- [[K-means]] is an {{[[Unsupervised]]}} that organises unlabelled data into meaningful groups.
- Initially have to pick a [[hyperparameter]] $k$ of the number of clusters. To choose the correct number of clusters in [[K-means]] we use a {{[[WCSS and elbow method]]}} diagram.
- [[K-means]] works by ;; Randomly choosing k points (centroids), grouping the remaining data to closest centroid, redefining the centroid, then repeating. Where each sample will get the label of the cluster it was assigned to.
- You would want to use scatterplot, to plot clusters with centroids.
- Has the ability to be updated with new information and compare difference in centroids.
