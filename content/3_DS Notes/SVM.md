Soft margins are a measure of how the borders mix, softer more mixing

Allows for miscalculations ([[outliers]]) allowing bias/variance tradeoff.

Soft margins are observations at the edges of data clusters.

## Q&A's

SVM are a generalisation of;; support vector classifiers (SVC), which place a hyperplane between datasets.

To get to higher dimension use a {{[[kernel classifier function]]}} using a Kernel Trick. Two types are {{Polynomial and Radial (exponential)}}.
<!--SR:!2000-01-01,1,250!2024-04-08,4,270-->

SVM are used over SVC when there is;; no clear linear way to split the data.

How SVM work:
?
1) Starts in low dimension
2) Moves to a higher dimension
3) Places thresholds (hyperplanes) to divide groups of data using SVC.
