### [[CatBoost]]
- **Advantages**:
  - **Handling Categorical Features**: CAT natively handles categorical features without preprocessing, simplifying the workflow.
  - **Robustness to Overfitting**: Utilizes techniques like ordered boosting and per-feature scaling to mitigate overfitting.
  - **Performance**: Provides competitive performance with minimal hyperparameter tuning.
- **Relative Use Cases**:
  - Particularly useful when dealing with categorical features and datasets with missing values.
  - Suitable for scenarios where quick experimentation and model deployment are required.
