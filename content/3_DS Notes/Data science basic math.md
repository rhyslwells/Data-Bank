# Issues


# Notes

### vectorising code (linear algebra)

Better than using loops.

Use arrays to do many computations simultaneously;; this is call vectorised code.

### Image recognition  (linear algebra)

Convolutional neural networks, example MNIST (hand written letter recognition).

Breaks image into an array of colour data (RGB).

### Dimensionality reduction (linear algebra)

Given e.g data points in 3D (x,y,z) (which we model as a matrix) we can project to a plan (that matches the data) and reduce the data to a smaller matrix. 

Can reduce similar variables to a similar variable.
