The central limit theorem states that ;; that no matter the underlying distribution of the dataset, the sampling distribution of the means would approximate a ==normal distribution.==

Moreover, the mean of the sampling distribution would be equal to the mean of the original distribution and the variance would be n times smaller, where n is the size of the samples. 

The CLT applies whenever we have a s==um or an average of many variables== (e.g. sum of rolled numbers when rolling dice).

The CLT allows us to assume normality for many different variables. 

That is very useful for confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis.
