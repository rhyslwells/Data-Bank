#statistics 



observation, measurement, experiment, and the formulation, testing and modification of hypotheses.

H_0 null hypothesis to be tested.

H1 alternative.

Accept or reject H0 in favour of H1 based on a test.


To accept the null means that there isnâ€™t enough data to support the change or the innovation brought by the alternative. 

To reject the null means that there is enough statistical evidence that the status-quo is not representative of the truth.

To reject H0 we must have a small p- value 'in the tails'
