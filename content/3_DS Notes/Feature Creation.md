# What is involved:


- Create new features from existing ones (e.g., ratios, interactions).
- Transform features to better capture non-linear relationships.
- Reduce dimensionality if necessary (e.g., PCA).


Its more the term given to the iterative process of building good features for a better model.

Makes relevant features (using formulas and relations between others). 
# Example:

Predicting house prices. Raw features might be square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. Feature engineering could involve:

- Combining square footage and bedrooms into a "living space" feature.
# When are we done:

When we have a refined and optimised model.

#### What new features can we add?

We can combine related features.
