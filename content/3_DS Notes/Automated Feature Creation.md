Question: Can autodetect meaningful features.

#### Rough notes


[[Feature Creation]] was an ad-hoc manual process that depended on domain knowledge, intuition, data exploration and creativity. However, this process is dataset-dependent, time-consuming, tedious, subjective, and it is not a scalable solution. [[Automated Feature Creation]] automatically generates features using a framework; these features can be filtered using Feature Selection to avoid feature explosion. Below you can find some popular open source libraries for automated feature engineering:

- Pycaret – [PyCaret](https://pycaret.org/)
- Featuretools for advanced usage [Home](https://www.featuretools.com/) [What is Featuretools? — Featuretools 1.1.0 documentation  
    ](https://featuretools.alteryx.com/en/stable/)
- Optuna –[A hyperparameter optimization framework](https://optuna.org/)
