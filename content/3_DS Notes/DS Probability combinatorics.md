# Notes

### Expected values

Expected values $E(A)$ gives the chance of event occurring.

Expected values are in intervals as are often unobtainable and give idea of likelihood of an event occurring.

For Categorical outcomes of experiments use $E(A)=P(A)\times n$ for n = number of times experiment is run.

For Numerical outcomes of experiments use $E(A)=A \times P(A)+...+Z \times P(Z)$

#### Example
For example, if you roll a six-sided die, the possible outcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The probability of each outcome is 1/6. The expected value of rolling a die is therefore:

E=1⋅1/6+2⋅1/6+3⋅1/6+4⋅1/6+5⋅1/6+6⋅1/6=3.5

This means that if you were to roll a die many times, you would expect to get an average of 3.5 on each roll.

### Probability frequency distribution

Shown as graph or table (Outcomes, frequency, probability columns) as a graph X is outcome, y in probability. 

### Events and probability

Independent events occurring simultaneously we take $P(A)*P(B)$.
We have $P(A)+P(B)>1$ if outcomes occur simultaneously
We have $P(A)+P(B)<1$ if not accounted for an event.
Complements are $A'=A^c$ and $P(A')=1-P(A)$
$\sum P(A)=1$ over a list of events A.

### Permutation

Permutations are the number of ways to combine the n outcomes, P(n)= n!

### Variations with repetition

total number of ways to pick then arrange some of elements from a set with repetitions.

Same as separate sample spaces.

$V^n_p=n^p$

{a,b,c} choice two are 3x3. 

### Variations without repetition

Variations formula is:  $V_{p}^n=n!/(n-p)!$ choices no reps different each time.

### Combinations (without repetitions)

All the permutations of a **single combination** are different **variations** that is $C^n_p=V/P=V^n_p / p! $

Taking combinations is symmetrical.

### Combinations with separate sample spaces

### Combinations with repetitions (not C(r,n)) 

formula is: $(n+p-1)!/(n-1)!p!$
