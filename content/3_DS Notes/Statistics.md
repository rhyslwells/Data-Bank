What is a p-value?;; A p-value is a measure of the evidence against a null hypothesis.

What is a confidence interval?;; A confidence interval displays the probability that a parameter will fall between a pair of values around the mean.

**Explain the concept of the Central Limit Theorem.**;; The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of the sum (or average) of a large number of independent, identically distributed random variables approaches a normal distribution, regardless of the original distribution.

What is the meaning of [[Correlation]] does not imply causation?;;Correlation measures the statistical association between two variables, while causation implies a cause-and-effect relationship. [[Correlation vs Causation]]

What is a [[Markov chain]];; It is a stochastic model that describes a sequence of events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event.

What is the difference between a parametric and a non-parametric test?
?
[[Parametric tests ]] are statistical tests that make ==assumptions about the distribution== of the data. For example, a t-test assumes that the data is normally distributed. Non-parametric tests do not make assumptions about the distribution of the data. Parametric tests are generally more powerful than non-parametric tests, but they are only valid if the data meets the assumptions of the test. [[Non-parametric tests ]] are less powerful than parametric tests, but they can be used on any type of data, regardless of the distribution.
