Command Prompt (cmd) is a command-line interpreter on Windows systems that allows users to execute commands to perform various basic tasks. Here are some common tasks that can be performed in cmd along with examples:

### 1. **Navigating the File System:**
   - **Changing Directories:**
     ```cmd
     cd C:\path\to\directory
     ```
     Changes the current directory to `C:\path\to\directory`.

   - **Listing Files and Directories:**
     ```cmd
     dir
     ```
     Lists the files and directories in the current directory.

### 2. **Managing Files and Directories:**
   - **Creating a Directory:**
     ```cmd
     mkdir newfolder
     ```
     Creates a new directory named `newfolder`.

   - **Deleting a Directory:**
     ```cmd
     rmdir /s /q newfolder
     ```
     Deletes the directory `newfolder` and its contents. The `/s` flag removes all directories and files in the specified directory, and the `/q` flag runs the command quietly without asking for confirmation.

   - **Copying Files:**
     ```cmd
     copy C:\source\file.txt D:\destination\
     ```
     Copies `file.txt` from the `C:\source` directory to the `D:\destination` directory.

   - **Renaming Files:**
     ```cmd
     ren oldfile.txt newfile.txt
     ```
     Renames `oldfile.txt` to `newfile.txt`.

   - **Deleting Files:**
     ```cmd
     del file.txt
     ```
     Deletes `file.txt`.

### 3. **Viewing and Managing System Information:**
   - **Viewing IP Configuration:**
     ```cmd
     ipconfig
     ```
     Displays the current network configuration.

   - **Viewing System Information:**
     ```cmd
     systeminfo
     ```
     Provides detailed system information including OS version, hardware details, and network configurations.

### 4. **Managing Processes:**
   - **Viewing Running Processes:**
     ```cmd
     tasklist
     ```
     Lists all currently running processes.

   - **Killing a Process:**
     ```cmd
     taskkill /F /PID 1234
     ```
     Terminates the process with the Process ID (PID) `1234`. The `/F` flag forces the process to terminate.

### 5. **Networking Commands:**
   - **Pinging a Server:**
     ```cmd
     ping www.example.com
     ```
     Sends ICMP Echo Request packets to the specified host and displays the response.

   - **Tracing Route to a Server:**
     ```cmd
     tracert www.example.com
     ```
     Traces the route packets take to the specified host.

### 6. **Batch File Scripting:**
   - **Creating and Running a Simple Batch File:**
     - Create a file named `example.bat` with the following content:
       ```cmd
       @echo off
       echo Hello, World!
       pause
       ```
     - Run the batch file:
       ```cmd
       example.bat
       ```
     This batch file prints "Hello, World!" to the console and waits for the user to press a key before closing.

### 7. **Environment Variables:**
   - **Viewing Environment Variables:**
     ```cmd
     set
     ```
     Displays all current environment variables and their values.

   - **Setting an Environment Variable:**
     ```cmd
     set MYVAR=Hello
     ```
     Sets an environment variable `MYVAR` with the value `Hello`.

### 8. **Disk Operations:**
   - **Checking Disk Usage:**
     ```cmd
     chkdsk C:
     ```
     Checks the file system and file system metadata of the C: drive for logical and physical errors.

   - **Formatting a Disk:**
     ```cmd
     format D: /FS:NTFS
     ```
     Formats the D: drive with the NTFS file system.

### 9. **Echoing Messages:**
   - **Displaying a Message:**
     ```cmd
     echo Hello, World!
     ```
     Prints `Hello, World!` to the console.

### 10. **Redirecting Output:**
   - **Redirecting Command Output to a File:**
     ```cmd
     dir > output.txt
     ```
     Redirects the output of the `dir` command to `output.txt`.

These examples illustrate some of the basic functionalities of Command Prompt. While cmd is less powerful compared to PowerShell, it remains useful for simple file system navigation, file management, and running legacy scripts.
