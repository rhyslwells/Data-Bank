A strongly-typed functional programming language that runs on the JVM, [[JavaScript]], and native byte code. He highlights the productivity benefits of Scala, emphasizing its features such as:

1. **Functional Programming**: Scala includes functional programming essentials like lambdas, functions as values, pattern matching, and data classes.
    
2. **Advanced Features**: Scala offers advanced capabilities like ==term inference==, higher-order types, and meta programming, which allow for more elegant and expressive code.
    
3. **Immutability**: Scala promotes immutability, with immutable data structures being the default, enhancing thread safety and making code easier to understand.
    
4. **Expressive Data Manipulation**: Scala provides powerful tools for manipulating data, making it concise, readable, and type-safe.
Used for [[Data modelling]]

==Immutability first language==

concise and readable code

1. **Meta Programming**: Scala's meta programming capabilities allow for compile-time code generation, ensuring type correctness and reducing runtime errors.
    
6. **Library Over Framework**: Scala encourages using libraries over frameworks, offering flexibility and freedom in code design.
    
7. **Type System**: Scala's advanced type system helps in making illegal states unrepresentable, reducing the need for extensive runtime tests and enabling robust code verification at compile time.
    

Varsky concludes by mentioning the upcoming ==Scala 3==, which aims to polish the language further, and directs viewers to resources for learning more about Scala.
