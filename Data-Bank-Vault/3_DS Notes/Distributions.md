# Notes

**Types of Distributions:**

**Discrete Distributions:** Probability concentrated on specific values (e.g., coin flips, number of customers).
    
- **Uniform:** All outcomes equally likely (e.g., drawing a card from a shuffled deck).
- **Bernoulli:** Two possible outcomes (e.g., coin flip, true/false).
- **Binomial:** Sequence of Bernoulli trials (e.g., number of heads in 10 coin flips).
- **Poisson:** Frequency of events in a fixed interval (e.g., website visits per hour).
    


**Common Continuous Distributions:** Probability spread over a continuous range
- **Normal (Gaussian):** Bell-shaped curve, symmetric, thin tails (e.g., heights, exam scores). 
- **T:** Similar to normal but with fatter tails, used with limited data. 
- **Chi-squared:** Asymmetric, non-negative, used in hypothesis testing. 
- **Exponential:** Models time between events (e.g., website traffic, radioactive decay). 
- **Logistic:** S-shaped curve, used in forecasting and modeling growth.




## Practical 

**What is the distribution of numerical feature values across the samples?**

**What is the distribution of categorical features?**
```python
g = sns.FacetGrid(df, col='Survived')
g.map(plt.hist, 'var1', bins=20)
