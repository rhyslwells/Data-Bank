### **Snowflake**

1. **Architecture**:
   - **Cloud-Native**: Snowflake is a fully managed, cloud-native data warehousing service. It operates entirely on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google [[Cloud]].
   - **Separation of Storage and Compute**: Snowflake separates storage from compute, allowing for independent scaling of each. This means you can scale up compute resources without affecting storage capacity and vice versa.
   - **Multi-Cluster Shared Data Architecture**: Snowflake uses a multi-cluster architecture to handle concurrent workloads, ensuring high performance and minimal contention.

2. **Data Storage**:
   - **Structured Data**: Primarily designed for structured data and optimized for SQL queries and analytics.
   - **Semi-Structured Data**: Also supports semi-structured data like JSON, Avro, and Parquet through its native capabilities.

3. **Management**:
   - **Fully Managed Service**: Snowflake handles infrastructure management, optimization, and maintenance tasks automatically, requiring minimal administrative effort from users.

4. **Performance**:
   - **High Performance**: Optimized for fast query performance, particularly for complex analytical queries. It uses advanced optimizations like automatic clustering and caching.

5. **Use Cases**:
   - **[[Data warehouse]]: Ideal for enterprise data warehousing, business intelligence, and analytics.
   - **Data Lake**: Can function as a data lake with support for semi-structured data.
