#project 


Is the Rescue boat interested in collaborating on a project to improve overall efficiency? I aim to deliver insightful reports in three key areas, each of which can be customized further based on our discussions:

Preparedness:
I can produce a reports showing historical trends including graphical representations of key factors.

Prediction:
By analysing patterns in historical data could allow us to predict potential increased risks of incidents (e.g., on specific days/weather), enabling the implementation of proactive preventive measures. These insights can inform training and preparedness efforts, as well as facilitate collaboration with other agencies scheduled appropriately.


Public awareness:
I propose scheduling impactful Instagram posts using key words, engagement rates, and reach metrics.  Additionally bots/templates can be employed to streamline content distribution.

With more information in these three areas, we can provide valuable insights to make informed decisions and enhance the overall efficiency of the organization. If there is interest from the Rescue boat committee, we have the following questions:

Data gathering questions:
- Do you currently have any analytics or reports on incidents?
- What is the current reporting process, and in what format is it presented?
- When is this information shared with the team?
- What information is recorded before and after an incident, and do you have access to that?

Patterns analysis questions:
Are there specific patterns you are interested in understanding related to these areas? For example:

- Time and day of the week patterns.
- Seasonal and weather-related patterns.
- Hotspots for incidents.

Stakeholder questions:
- Would anyone be willing to allocate time for me to ask them questions?
- Is there anyone with experience in data analysis interested in getting involved?

What I need to proceed:
- All information related to the above questions, particularly any Excel documents on incidents, taking into account data privacy concerns.
- Time to discuss the project with stakeholders.

This project not only provides me with valuable practice in data analysis but also contributes to my professional growth. Additionally, I believe it could genuinely benefit the organization.
