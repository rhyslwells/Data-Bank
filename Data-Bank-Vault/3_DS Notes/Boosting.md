What is [[Boosting]]?;; is an [[Ensemble model]] which builds a ==sequence== of base models iteratively, where each subsequent model focuses on correcting the errors made by the previous ones.   It combines weak learners (models that are slightly better than random guessing) to create a strong learner. Examples include ==AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.==
