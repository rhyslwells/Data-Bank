Also called [[Cost Function]] and [[error function]].

## Description

A loss function measures how well the model fits the data and guides the optimization process. 

The loss function measures the disparity between the model's predictions and the actual target values.

Evaluates how well it fits the training data, very close to the idea of [[overfitting]].

The objective is to ==minimize this loss function==.

## Examples

What would be a loss function in the following types of problems:

[[Regression]]
- [[Linear Regression]] (actually in many regression tasks)
	loss function is [[mean square error]], [[mean absolute error]],...

[[Classification]]
	- [[Cross entropy]]




## Questions and answers

What is a [[loss function]]?;; Function the measures how well a neural network's predictions match the actual target values, which we want to minimize and used in training and evaluation.
