Can values for X,y be categroical ? [[Encode categorical features]]

BernoulliNB()
## Notes:


Why Naive Bayes?;;Order doesn't matter, features are independent. Treated it as a [[Bag of words]]. Which ==simplifies==  the above equation.

Want to use this in classifiers for ML
Want to understand: [[Multinomial Naive bayes]] classifer 
There is also: [[Gaussian Naive Bayes]]

#### Issues

To avoid having 0 probability sometimes they add ==counts== $\alpha$ to do this.

## Formula
$$P(A|B)=P(A) \times \frac{P(B|A)}{P(B)}$$
Think of the line as "given".
## Examples

### Example 1

### [Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRl8Yq0M3TY) 2

In the formula above P(A) is P(+),  P(B)=P(NEW)

P(B|A) = P(A=0|+)*... *P(C=0|+)

P(A=0,B=1,C=0) is the same for both + and - class so remove.

### Example Car accidents

What's the probability of car having an accident given that driver is driving in summer, there is no rain, it's a night and it's an urban area?

#### Mock data:

| Season | Weather | Daytime | Area | Did Accident Occur? |
|------|------|------|------|------|
| Summer | No-Raining | Night | Urban | No |
| Summer | No-Raining | Day | Urban | No |
| Summer | Raining | Night | Rural | No |
| Summer | Raining | Night | Urban | Yes |
| Summer | Raining | Day | Urban | No |
| Summer | Raining | Night | Rural | No |
| Winter | Raining | Night | Urban | Yes |
| Winter | Raining | Night | Urban | Yes |
| Winter | Raining | Night | Rural | Yes |
| Winter | No-Raining | Night | Rural | No |
| Winter | No-Raining | Night | Urban | No |
| Winter | No-Raining | Day | Urban | Yes |
| Spring | No-Raining | Night | Rural | Yes |
| Spring | No-Raining | Day | Rural | Yes |
| Spring | Raining | Night | Urban | No |
| Spring | Raining | Day | No | No |
| Spring | No-Raining | Night | Urban | No |
| Autumn | Raining | Night | Urban | Yes |
| Autumn | Raining | Day | Rural | Yes |
| Autumn | No-Raining | Night | Urban | No |
| Autumn | No-Raining | Day | Rural | No |
| Autumn | No-Raining | Day | Urban | No |
| Autumn | Raining | Day | Yes | No |
| Autumn | Raining | Night | Yes | No |
| Autumn | No-Raining | Night | No | No |

To handle data like this it is possible to calculate frequencies for each case:

#### 0. Accident probability
$P(Accident) = \frac{9}{25} = 0.36$

$P(No-Accident) = \frac{16}{25} = 0.64$

#### 1. Season probability

Frequency table:

| Season | Accident | No Accident | |
|------|------|------|------|
| Spring | 2/9 | 3/16 | 5/25 |
| Summer | 1/9 | 5/16 | 6/25 |
| Autumn | 2/9 | 6/16 | 8/25 |
| Winter | 4/9 | 2/16 | 6/25 |
| |9/25|16/25| |

Probabilities based on table:
 
$P(Spring) = \frac{5}{25} = 0.20$

$P(Summer) = \frac{6}{25} = 0.24$

$P(Autumn) = \frac{8}{25} = 0.32$

$P(Winter) = \frac{6}{25} = 0.24$

$P(Spring | Accident) = \frac{2}{9} = 0.22$

$P(Summer | Accident) = \frac{1}{9} = 0.11$

$P(Autumn | Accident) = \frac{2}{9} = 0.22$

$P(Winter | Accident) = \frac{4}{9} = 0.44$

#### 2. Weather probability

Frequency table:

| | Accident | No Accident | |
|------|------|------|------|
| Raining | 6/9 | 7/16 | 13/25 |
| No-Raining | 3/9 | 9/16 | 12/25 |
| | 9/25 | 16/25 | |

Probabilities based on table:

$P(Raining) = \frac{13}{25} = 0.52$

$P(No-Raining) = \frac{12}{25} = 0.48$

$P(Raining|Accident) = \frac{6}{9} = 0.667$

$P(No-Raining|Accident) = \frac{12}{25} = 0.333$


#### 3. Daytime probability

Frequency table:

| | Accident | No Accident | |
|------|------|------|------|
| Day | 3/9 | 6/16 | 9/25 |
| Night | 6/9 | 10/16 | 16/25 |
| | 9/25 | 16/25 | |

Probabilities based on table:

$P(Day) = \frac{9}{25} = 0.36$

$P(Night) = \frac{16}{25} = 0.64$

$P(Day|Accident) = \frac{3}{9} = 0.333$

$P(Night|Accident) = \frac{6}{9} = 0.667$

#### 4. Area probability

Frequency table:

| | Accident | No Accident | |
|------|------|------|------|
| Urban Area | 5/9 | 8/16 | 13/25 |
| Rural Area | 4/9 | 8/16 | 12/25 |
| | 9/25 | 16/25 | |

Probabilities based on table:

$P(Urban) = \frac{13}{25} = 0.52$

$P(Rural) = \frac{12}{25} = 0.48$

$P(Urban|Accident) = \frac{5}{9} = 0.556$

$P(Rural|Accident) = \frac{4}{9} = 0.444$

#### Assemble:

Calculating probablity of car accident occuring in summer, when there is no rain and during night, in urban area.

Where B equals to:
- Season: Summer
- Weather: No-Raining
- Daytime: Night
- Area: Urban

Where A equals to:
- Accident

Using Naive Bayes:

$P(A|B) = P(Accident | Season = Summer, Weather = No-Raining, Daytime = Night, Area = Urban)$

$P(A|B) = \frac{P(Summer|Accident)P(No-Raining|Accident)P(Night|Accident)P(Urban|Accident)P(Accident)}{P(Summer)P(No-Raining)P(Night)P(Urban)}$

$P(A|B) = \frac{\frac{1}{9}\frac{6}{9}\frac{6}{9}\frac{5}{9}\frac{9}{25}}{\frac{6}{25}\frac{12}{25}\frac{16}{25}\frac{13}{25}} = \frac{0.111\cdot0.667\cdot0.667\cdot0.556\cdot0.36}{0.24\cdot0.48\cdot0.64\cdot0.52} = \frac{0.0099}{0.038} = 0.26$

---

$P(A)=P(Accident)$

$P(B)=P(Summer)P(No-Raining)P(Night)P(Urban)$

$P(B|A)=P(Summer|Accident)P(No-Raining|Accident)P(Night|Accident)P(Urban|Accident)$
