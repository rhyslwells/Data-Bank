PowerShell and Command Prompt (cmd) are both command-line interfaces available on Windows systems, but they differ significantly in their capabilities, syntax, and scripting abilities. Here are the key differences and examples that highlight their distinct features:

### [[PowerShell]]:

1. **Object-Oriented Shell:**
   - PowerShell is designed around the concept of objects rather than text streams like cmd. This makes it more powerful for scripting and automation tasks.
   - **Example:** Getting detailed information about files:
     ```powershell
     Get-ChildItem | Select-Object Name, Length, LastWriteTime
     ```
     This command retrieves file objects and selects specific properties (Name, Length, LastWriteTime).

2. **Extensive Commandlets (Cmdlets):**
   - PowerShell includes a wide range of cmdlets for performing specific tasks, such as managing Active Directory, working with files, or interacting with web services.
   - **Example:** Restarting a service:
     ```powershell
     Restart-Service -Name "serviceName"
     ```
     This cmdlet restarts a service named "serviceName".

3. **Advanced Scripting and Automation:**
   - PowerShell supports advanced scripting features, including loops, conditional statements, functions, and error handling.
   - **Example:** Checking if a file exists:
     ```powershell
     if (Test-Path -Path "C:\path\to\file.txt") {
         Write-Output "File exists."
     } else {
         Write-Output "File does not exist."
     }
     ```
     This script uses `Test-Path` cmdlet to check if a file exists and then outputs a message accordingly.

4. **Integration with .NET Framework:**
   - PowerShell can leverage .NET Framework libraries and assemblies directly within scripts.
   - **Example:** Using .NET Framework classes:
     ```powershell
     [System.IO.File]::ReadAllText("C:\path\to\file.txt")
     ```
     This line reads the entire content of a text file using .NET Framework's `File` class.

### [[Command Prompt]] (cmd):

1. **Text-Based Command Line:**
   - Cmd operates primarily with text-based commands and outputs, lacking PowerShell's object-oriented approach.
   - **Example:** Listing files in a directory:
     ```
     dir /b
     ```
     This command lists all files in the current directory in a bare format.

2. **Limited Built-in Commands:**
   - Cmd has a more limited set of built-in commands (compared to PowerShell's cmdlets), focusing on basic system commands.
   - **Example:** Copying files:
     ```
     copy C:\source\file.txt D:\destination\
     ```
     This command copies a file from `C:\source` to `D:\destination`.

3. **Batch Scripting:**
   - Cmd uses batch files (.bat) for scripting, which are simpler and less flexible compared to PowerShell scripts.
   - **Example:** Simple batch file to copy files:
     ```
     @echo off
     copy C:\source\file.txt D:\destination\
     ```
     This batch script copies a file without displaying command prompt output.

4. **Direct Command Execution:**
   - Commands in cmd are executed directly without the pipeline and object manipulation features of PowerShell.
   - **Example:** Renaming a file:
     ```
     ren oldfile.txt newfile.txt
     ```
     This command renames a file from `oldfile.txt` to `newfile.txt`.

### Choosing Between PowerShell and cmd:

- **Use PowerShell When:**
  - You need to work with complex data structures or objects.
  - Automation and scripting tasks require advanced features like loops, conditions, and error handling.
  - Integration with .NET Framework or other external libraries is necessary.

- **Use Command Prompt (cmd) When:**
  - Performing basic system tasks or operations.
  - Working with simple text-based outputs.
  - Using legacy batch scripts or when PowerShell is unavailable.

In summary, PowerShell offers a more versatile and powerful environment for scripting, automation, and administrative tasks on Windows systems, while cmd remains useful for straightforward commands and basic system interactions.
