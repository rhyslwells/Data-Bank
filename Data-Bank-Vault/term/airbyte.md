[Airbyte](https://airbyte.com/) is the modern open-source [ELT](term/elt.md) standard and a [data integration](term/data%20integration.md) platform that syncs data from APIs, databases &Â files to [data warehouses](term/data%20warehouse.md), [lakes](term/data%20lake.md) and other destinations. In addition to covering the long tail of connectors with the involvement of its community, [[Airbyte Cloud]] differentiates itself with its transparent and predictable volume-based pricing. Airbyte addresses all connector needs through its open-source extensibility. Its ambition is to make [data integrations](term/data%20integration.md) a commodity.
