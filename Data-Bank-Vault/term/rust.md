Former Mozilla employee Graydon Hoare initially created [Rust](https://glossary.airbyte.com/term/rust) as a personal project. The first stable release, Rust 1.0 was released on May 15, 2015. Rust is a [**multi-paradigm programming language**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_multi-paradigm_programming_languages) that supports imperative procedural, concurrent actor, object-oriented and pure [functional](https://glossary.airbyte.com/term/functional-programming) styles, supporting generic programming and metaprogramming statically and dynamically.

> The goal of Rust is to be a good programming language for creating highly **concurrent, safe, and performant systems**. [Learning Rust](https://learning-rust.github.io/docs/a1.why_rust.html)
