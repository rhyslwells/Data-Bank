Jinja is a fast, expressive, extensible templating engine. Special placeholders in the template allow writing code similar to [Python](term/python.md) syntax. Then the template is passed data to render the final document.

Most popularized by [[dbt]].  Read more on the [Jinja Documentation](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/).
