A data engineer today oversees the whole data engineering process, from collecting data from various sources to making it available for downstream processes. The role requires familiarity with the multiple stages of the data engineering lifecycle and an aptitude for evaluating data tools for optimal performance across several dimensions, including price, speed, flexibility, scalability, simplicity, reusability, and interoperability.
