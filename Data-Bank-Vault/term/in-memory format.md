In-memory formats are optimized to:
- hit fast instruction sets 
- be cache friendly 
- be parallelizable

Formats:
- [Apache Arrow](term/apache%20arrow.md) 
- [Apache Spark](Apache%20Spark) [[DataFrames]]
- [NumPy](term/numpy.md)
- [Pandas](term/pandas.md)

The opposed to in-memory formats are [Data Lake File Formats](Data%20Lake%20File%20Formats) which save space, be cross-language and serve as long-term storage. More on the Data AI Summit talk about [From bits to Data Frames](https://microsites.databricks.com/sites/default/files/2022-07/Sound-Data-Engineering-in-Rust_From-Bits%20to-DataFrames.pdf) by Jorge C Leitao.
