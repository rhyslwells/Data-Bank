A Data Orchestrator models dependencies between different tasks in [complex heterogeneous cloud environments](https://mattturck.com/data2021/) end-to-end. It handles integrations with legacy systems, new cloud-based tools, and your data lakes and data warehouses. It invokes [computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchestration_(computing)), such as wrangling your business logic in [SQL](term/sql.md) and [Python](term/python.md) and applying ML models at the right time based on a time-based trigger or by custom-defined logic.
