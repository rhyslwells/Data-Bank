Apache Spark™ is an open-source multi-language engine for executing [Data Engineering](term/data%20engineering.md)  and [Machine Learning](term/machine%20learning.md) on single-node machines or clusters. It's optimized for large-scale data processing.

Spark runs well with [Kubernetes](term/kubernetes.md).
