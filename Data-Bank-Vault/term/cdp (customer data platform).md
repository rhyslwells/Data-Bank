A customer Data Platform (CDP) is a system that collects large quantities of customer data (i.e. information about your customers) from a variety of channels and devices, helping to make this data more accessible to the people who need it. CDPs are responsible for sorting and categorizing data, as well as data cleansing to remove inaccurate or out-of-date information.
