The [Data Mesh Paper](https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-monolith-to-mesh.html) tries to eliminate silos between data teams, ensuring that the experience and knowledge about data are shared among all data consumers in the company. Data Mesh sees [Data as a Product](term/data%20product.md). Data meshes are also about connecting platforms that those teams are using so data can be easily moved around for the organization's benefit. Companies will try to find better ways of unifying and connecting the tools so that data professionals don’t have to switch and work in a silo.

Data meshes try to eliminate the tensions between decentralizing and centralizing data resources, with some common infrastructure but otherwise mostly decentralized. It empowers data teams and gives ownership to domain experts.
