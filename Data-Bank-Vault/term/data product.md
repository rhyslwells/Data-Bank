[DJ Patil](https://twitter.com/dpatil), the former Chief Data Scientist of the United States, defined a data product as "a product that facilitates an end goal through data." Also, [Data Mesh](term/data%20mesh.md) talks about "data as a product." It applies more product thinking, whereas the "Data Product" essentially is a dashboard, report, and table in a [Data Warehouse](term/data%20warehouse.md) or a Machine Learning model. Sometimes Data Products are also called [Data Asset](term/data%20asset.md)s.
