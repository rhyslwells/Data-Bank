Apache Iceberg is a [Data Lake Table Format](term/data%20lake%20table%20format.md) and was [initially developed](https://github.com/Netflix/iceberg) at Netflix to solve long-standing issues using huge, petabyte-scale tables. It was open-sourced in 2018 as an Apache Incubator project and graduated from the incubator on the 19th of May 2020. Their [first public commit](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/commit/a5eb3f6ba171ecfc517a4f09ae9654e7d8ae0291) was 2017-12-19—more insights about the story on [A Short Introduction to Apache Iceberg](https://medium.com/expedia-group-tech/a-short-introduction-to-apache-iceberg-d34f628b6799).
