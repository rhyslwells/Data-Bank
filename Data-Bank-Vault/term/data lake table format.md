Data lake table formats are very attractive as they are databases on [Data Lake](term/data%20lake.md). Same as a table, one **data lake table format bundles distributed files into one table that is otherwise hard to manage**. You can think of it as an abstraction layer between your physical data files and how they are structured to form a table.



It is built on top o the [Storage Layer](term/storage%20layer%20object%20store.md) and [Data Lake File Format](term/data%20lake%20file%20format.md). Table Formats are [Delta Lake](term/delta%20lake.md), [Apache Iceberg](term/apache%20iceberg.md) or [Apache Hudi](term/apache%20hudi.md).
