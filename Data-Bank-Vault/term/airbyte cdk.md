The Airbyte CDK (Connector Development Kit) allows you to create connectors for Sources or Destinations. If your source or destination doesn't exist, you can use the CDK to make the building process a lot easier. It generates all the tests and files you need and all you need to do is write the connector-specific code for your source or destination. 

An extensive [Step-by-Step Example](https://airbyte.com/tutorials/extract-data-from-the-webflow-api) of how to create a custom Airbyte source connector with the [Python CDK](https://docs.airbyte.com/connector-development/cdk-python/). Another example by the Faros AI team created with [Javascript/Typescript](https://docs.airbyte.com/connector-development/cdk-faros-js).
