It’s a platform that allows you to run and orchestrate container workloads. [**Kubernetes**](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/05/29/why-kubernetes-getting-so-popular/) **has become the de-facto standard** for your cloud-native apps to (auto-) [scale-out](https://stackoverflow.com/a/11715598/5246670) and deploy your open-source zoo fast, cloud-provider-independent. No lock-in here. Kubernetes is the **move from infrastructure as code** towards **infrastructure as data**, specifically as [YAML](term/yaml.md). With Kubernetes, developers can quickly write applications that run across multiple operating environments. Costs can be reduced by scaling down.
