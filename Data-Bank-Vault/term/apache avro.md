Avro is an open-source data serialization system that helps with data exchange between systems, [programming languages](term/programming%20languages.md), and processing frameworks. Avro helps define a binary format for your data, as well as map it to the programming language of your choice.

Avro has a JSON-like data model, but can be represented as either JSON or in a compact binary form. It comes with a **very sophisticated schema description language** that describes data. Avro is another [Data Lake File Format](term/data%20lake%20file%20format.md).
