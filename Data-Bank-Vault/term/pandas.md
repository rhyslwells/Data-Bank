Pandas is a software library written for the [Python](term/python.md) programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. It is free software released under the three-clause BSD license. 

## What is a Pandas DataFrame
Two-dimensional, size-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular data.

The data structure also contains labeled axes (rows and columns). Arithmetic operations align on both row and column labels. It can be thought of as a dict-like container for Series objects. The primary Pandas data structure.

See more on [Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html).

Another DataFrame with the same API is [Koalas](https://github.com/databricks/koalas), created by Databricks, optimized for more extensive data sets, and [Apache Spark](term/apache%20spark.md).
