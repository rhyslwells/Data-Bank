A Data Catalog is a centralized store where all metadata data about your data is made searchable.

**Think about a Google Search for your internal Metadata**. This is vital, as with [Data Lake](term/data%20lake.md) and other data stores, and you want the ability to search for your data. Data is growing exponentially, with 90% of the world’s data being generated alone in the last two years. It's hard to keep this amount over time. A data catalog solves the problem of the fast-growing handling of data internally.

An interesting read about the beginning of the Data Catalog is explained in the 2017 published paper about a [Data Context Service](http://cidrdb.org/cidr2017/papers/p111-hellerstein-cidr17.pdf).
