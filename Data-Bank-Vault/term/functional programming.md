Functional Programming is a style of building functions that threaten computation as a mathematical function that avoids changing state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming expressive and [declarative](term/declarative.md) as opposed to imperative. It's getting more popular with the rise of [Functional Data Engineering](term/functional%20data%20engineering.md).
